# Telecom Churn Project
Additional Notes
Why This Project Matters

Customer churn is one of the most important KPIs in the telecom industry.
Understanding churn behavior helps companies:

Reduce revenue loss

Improve customer retention

Implement targeted engagement strategies

Design better pricing and service plans

This project demonstrates how data science can directly support these business goals.

Future Enhancements

Planned improvements that can extend and strengthen this project:

Add SHAP-based explainability for model interpretation

Build more advanced models such as XGBoost, LightGBM, or CatBoost

Integrate real customer feedback or text data for sentiment-driven churn analysis

Deploy a backend API using FastAPI and connect Streamlit through REST endpoints

Set up GitHub Actions CI/CD for automated testing and deployment

Build a dashboard (Power BI, Tableau, or Streamlit multipage) for continuous monitoring

These enhancements can evolve this project into a fully production-ready machine learning solution.
